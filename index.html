    <h4>iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      Apple today introduced <b>iPhone 14</b> and <b>iPhone 14 Plus</b>, featuring two sizes —
      6.1 inches and 6.7 inches — in a sophisticated design with impressive
      camera upgrades and groundbreaking new safety capabilities. iPhone 14 and
      iPhone 14 Plus take stunning photos and video with a powerful camera
      system featuring new Main and front TrueDepth cameras, the Ultra Wide
      camera for unique perspectives, and Photonic Engine — an enhanced image
      pipeline. Both models include the A15 Bionic chip with a 5-core GPU, which
      offers incredible performance and efficiency for demanding workloads, and
      is designed with privacy and security built in. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14
      Plus introduce critical safety capabilities such as Crash Detection and
      Emergency SOS via satellite, a first in the industry. And with amazing
      battery life, industry-leading durability features, and super-fast 5G,
      this iPhone lineup is more advanced than ever before. iPhone 14 and iPhone
      14 Plus will be available in midnight, blue, starlight, purple, and
      (PRODUCT)RED1 finishes. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 9, with
      availability for iPhone 14 beginning Friday, September 16, and
      availability for iPhone 14 Plus beginning Friday, October 7.
      <br />
      <br />
      <em>“Our customers rely on their iPhone every day, and iPhone 14 and iPhone 14
      Plus introduce groundbreaking new technologies and important safety
      capabilities. With the new, larger 6.7-inch display on iPhone 14 Plus,
      users can enjoy more content onscreen when browsing the web and even more
      text,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide
      Marketing. “Both phones have a powerful new Main camera with a huge leap
      in low-light performance, advanced connectivity capabilities with 5G and
      eSIM, and the incredible performance of A15 Bionic, which helps enable
      even better battery life. All of this, tightly integrated with iOS 16,
      makes iPhone more essential than ever.”</em> - CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA

    <h4>iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      Apple today announced <b>iPhone 14</b> Pro and <b>iPhone 14 Pro Max</b>, the most
      advanced Pro lineup ever, featuring the Dynamic Island — a new design that
      introduces an intuitive way to experience iPhone — and the Always-On
      display. Powered by A16 Bionic, the fastest chip ever in a smartphone,
      iPhone 14 Pro introduces a new class of pro camera system, with the
      first-ever 48MP Main camera on iPhone featuring a quad-pixel sensor, and
      Photonic Engine, an enhanced image pipeline that dramatically improves
      low-light photos. These groundbreaking advancements make iPhone even more
      indispensable for everyday tasks, creative projects, and now even
      emergency situations with features such as Emergency SOS via satellite and
      Crash Detection. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will be available in
      four gorgeous new finishes: deep purple, silver, gold, and space black.
      Pre-orders begin Friday, September 9, with availability beginning Friday,
      September 16.
      <br />
      <br />
      <em>“Our customers count on their iPhone every day, and with iPhone 14 Pro and
      iPhone 14 Pro Max, we're delivering more advancements than any other
      iPhone. iPhone 14 Pro introduces a camera system that empowers every user
      — from the casual user to the professional — to take their best photos and
      video, and innovative new technologies like the Always-On display and the
      Dynamic Island, which offers new interactions for notifications and
      activities,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide
      Marketing. “Groundbreaking safety capabilities bring users even more
